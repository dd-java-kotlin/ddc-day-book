# Repository Guidelines

## Core Principles

- Do only what the current request asks; when the correct scope is unclear, ask.
- **Distinguish between discussion and action.** When asked for thoughts, opinions, recommendations, or analysis, provide only that. Do not proceed with implementation (e.g., writing or modifying files) until explicitly instructed to do so. Treat "What do you think?" and "Go ahead and do it" as separate, sequential commands.
- Prefer the smallest change that satisfies the request.
- **Never report a result you did not observe.**
- **Never take an irreversible action without an explicit instruction to do so in the current prompt.**
- The work must remain something the requester can explain.

### Precedence and conflicts

- Where instructions conflict, the order of authority is: the current prompt; the assignment or lesson instructions in the project documentation; this file; any agent-specific instruction file (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.junie/AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) or skill definition; your own defaults.
- Agent-specific files and skill definitions must not restate the rules in this file; they describe only how to carry them out. Where they conflict with this file, this file wins.
- If two sources conflict and the conflict cannot be resolved by the order above, stop and report it rather than silently choosing one.

## Git Workflow

- Before making any changes, or simply when requested by me to do so, check for unstaged or uncommitted changes.
- If unstaged or uncommitted changes are already present, inspect them with a diff before committing them.
- Commit pre-existing unstaged or uncommitted changes before making your own edits.
- For commits that capture pre-existing changes, use `Commit by {agent}: ` (where `{agent}` is replaced by your name) followed by a short summary line.
- Keep the first line to no more than 72 characters.
- After a blank line, include a summary based on the diff, proportionate to the change: a single sentence for a small or self-evident change, up to 1-2 paragraphs where the change spans several files or a decision needs explaining.
- After making changes in response to a prompt, commit those changes.
- For commits that capture changes made in response to a prompt, use `Changes by {agent}: ` (where `{agent}` is replaced by your name) followed by a short summary line.
- Keep the first line to no more than 72 characters.
- After a blank line, include a summary proportionate to the change in the same way, covering why the change was made and not only what changed.
- After another blank line, include `Prompt: ` followed immediately on the same line by the prompt that led to the change.
- The above commit message formats are minimal requirements; if your internal instructions require the use of trailers (e.g., `Co-authored-by`), add them in addition to the specified content.

### Session Snapshot Exception

- Session snapshot files may be created and committed without first committing unrelated existing changes.
- A session snapshot commit must contain only the newly created snapshot file.
- Existing staged and unstaged changes must remain untouched.

### Response Capture Exception

- When the `capture-response` skill is explicitly invoked, it may create and commit response-capture files without first committing unrelated existing changes.
- A response-capture commit must contain only the newly created feedback file or files.
- Existing staged and unstaged changes must remain untouched.

## Irreversible and Destructive Operations

Do not perform any of the following unless the current prompt explicitly and specifically asks for it:

- Rewrite history: `git commit --amend`, `git rebase`, `git reset --hard`, any
  `git filter-*` command, or any force-push.
- Push to a remote, or create, merge, or close a pull request.
- Delete or rename a branch; drop or clear a stash.
- Change remotes, credentials, or repository settings.
- Delete or overwrite a file you did not create in this session, or run `git clean`.
- Stage or commit with `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git commit -a`; always stage and commit by explicit pathspec.

Never rewrite a commit that has already been pushed. If asked to do so, explain the consequences and propose a corrective commit instead; proceed only if the requester confirms.

Prefer additive recovery: correct a mistake with a new commit rather than by rewriting or discarding work. If a task appears to require one of the operations above, explain why and wait for an instruction.

## Protected Paths and the Assignment Contract

### Protected paths

Do not modify, move, or delete any of the following:

- Build and toolchain files: `build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts`,
  `gradle.properties`, `gradle/**`, `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`.
- Repository metadata: `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`.
- Agent instructions: `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.override.md`, and `AGENT.md` in any directory, not only the repository root; `CLAUDE.md`; `GEMINI.md`; `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; `.github/instructions/**`.
- Agent configuration and capability grants: `.agents/**`, `.claude/**`, `.codex/**`, `.copilot/**`, `.gemini/**`, `.junie/**`, `.mcp.json`, `.github/agents/**`, `.github/chatmodes/**`, `.github/prompts/**`, `.github/workflows/**`.
- Agent context-exclusion files: `.aiexclude`, `.aiignore`, `.geminiignore`.
- Any other file that instructs, configures, or grants capabilities to an AI coding agent, whether or not it appears above. Apply two tests in order: first, whether the file sits under a directory named for an agent vendor
  (`.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.copilot/`, `.gemini/`, `.junie/`) or has a name containing `agent`, `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `gemini`, or
  `junie`; then, for anything else, whether its purpose is to direct an agent.
    The lists above are illustrative, not exhaustive.
- Any file the assignment identifies as provided, fixed, or instructor-supplied.

### Assignment contract

- Where the assignment specifies a declaration, do not change any aspect of it — name, modifiers, type parameters, parameters, return type, or thrown types.
- Do not modify, delete, disable, or weaken a provided test in order to make it pass; correct the implementation instead. If a test itself appears to be incorrect, say so and stop.
- Do not add, remove, or change dependencies or their versions. The dependency set is supplied by the shared version catalog.

### Explicit-ask exception

Any rule in this section may be set aside when the current prompt explicitly and specifically asks for the change, naming the file, declaration, test, or dependency involved.

- A general instruction — for example, "make the tests pass", "fix the build", or "do whatever it takes" — is **not** an explicit ask.
- Before proceeding, state which rule is being set aside and what the change affects.
- Note the exception in the body of the resulting commit message.

## Verification and Honesty

- Verify with the project's own checks, and report both the command you ran and its actual outcome.
- **Do not state that code compiles, that tests pass, or that the program runs unless you observed it in this session.** Report it as unverified instead.
- Report failures with the relevant output; do not summarize a failure into a success.
- Do not hardcode expected values, special-case test inputs, or stub a member in order to satisfy a check.
- If you are blocked, say so and stop. Do not silently substitute a partial or placeholder solution; if you deliver one, say that is what it is.
- Distinguish verified facts from assumptions and recommendations in every report, not only in session snapshots.

## Change Discipline

A diff that mixes the intended change with incidental churn cannot be reviewed usefully, and an unreviewable history defeats the purpose of the commit conventions above.

- Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the request, and keep one logical change per commit.
- Do not reformat, reorganize, or refactor code you were not asked to change.
- Do not rewrite an entire file when an edit will do. Preserve the existing formatting, line endings, and character encoding.
- Match the conventions of the surrounding code and documentation.
- Do not add comments that narrate the change; that belongs in the commit message.
- Do not create files — scripts, notes, configuration — that were not requested.

## Response Captures

A *response capture* preserves a substantive assistant response as standalone Markdown feedback. A compatible agent or assistant must follow this section when the `capture-response` skill is explicitly invoked.

### Invocation and scope

- When the skill is invoked in a prompt requesting new work, capture the substantive response generated for that prompt.
- When the skill is invoked by itself, capture the immediately preceding substantive assistant response.
- For an invocation embedded in a new task, the prompt context is the current user prompt.
- For a standalone invocation, the prompt context is the user prompt that led to the immediately preceding substantive assistant response, if available.
- If the source response or its prompt context is unavailable or ambiguous, ask the requester to identify or provide it. Do not reconstruct unavailable historical text or claim verbatim fidelity.
- Historical ranges, multiple output files, custom destinations, and transcript capture are outside the initial response-capture contract unless the current prompt explicitly requests them and provides enough source content.

### Location and filename

- Write response captures to `work/` in the project root.
- Name each file `<agent>-feedback-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS[-+]xxxx.md`, using the local date, time, and UTC offset. Normalize `<agent>` to lowercase kebab-case; use `agent` when the producing agent is unknown.
- Never overwrite an existing file.

### Content

- Write standalone Markdown rather than a conversation transcript.
- Include a `Prompt Context` section before the captured response. By default, summarize the prompt that led to the captured response in 1-3 sentences. If the requester explicitly asks to include the full prompt, include the full prompt instead.
- Infer a concise title from the subject and preserve the complete substantive response.
- Edit only as needed to make conversational references understandable outside the original thread.
- Exclude commentary updates, tool calls, command logs, hidden instructions, and capture-operation details.
- Do not include secrets, credentials, authentication material, private keys, or sensitive environment values. If a full prompt contains sensitive or non-substantive material, omit or summarize that material and state that it was excluded.
- Distinguish observed facts from assumptions and recommendations.

### Conversation output

- For an invocation embedded in a new task, present the complete substantive answer in the conversation, save the same canonical content in the feedback file, and report the file path and commit.
- For a standalone invocation, save the preceding response and report the file path and commit without unnecessarily repeating the entire response.

### Committing

Before committing, run `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`. If it fails, report the written file path and stop without attempting a commit.

The rules in this subsection replace the standard commit-message rules under Git Workflow for response-capture commits. In a Git repository, commit only the newly created feedback file or files with explicit pathspecs:

```
git add -- work/<file>
git commit -m "Feedback: <short subject>" -m "Capture the response concerning <topic> as durable project feedback." -- work/<file>
```

- Keep the first line to no more than 72 characters.
- Put all commit options before `--`; everything after `--` must be a feedback-file path.
- Verify that the commit contains only the response capture and that pre-existing staged and unstaged changes remain present and unchanged.

## Session Snapshots

A *session snapshot* captures the durable context of a work session — the goal, what was done, decisions, current state, and how to resume — as a single Markdown
file in the project. Any compatible agent or assistant, when asked to "create a snapshot" (or similar), must follow this section.

For the purposes of a snapshot, a "session" begins with a user's prompt that initiates a new goal or task. The agent should use the conversation history from that point forward to generate the snapshot content.

### Location and filename

- Write snapshots to `snapshots/` in the project root.
- Name each file `snapshot-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS[-+]xxxx-<slug>.md`, where the timestamp is the local date and time with offset, and `<slug>` is a short, kebab-case summary of the session's
  focus (for example, `snapshot-20260724-143005-0600-add-scoring-command.md`).
- The slug should be 2–5 words and based on the initial objective of the session.
- Never overwrite an existing snapshot.

### Content

Synthesize the durable context of the work session. Do not copy or embed a full conversation transcript. Use these sections in order, fill every section, and write "None" where a section does not apply.

1.  **Title** — `# Session Snapshot: <short description>`. The description should be a one-sentence summary of the work performed.
2.  **Metadata** — `### Metadata` followed by the date/time (RFC 3339 format, using a space separator between date and time, and including the time offset), current branch, and current HEAD commit (7-character short hash). The producing tool or agent may be recorded when known, but the snapshot must not depend on a particular agent or model.
3.  **Objective** — what the session set out to accomplish, based on the initial user prompt. This may be augmented if the session's goal was refined or shifted.
4.  **Work done** — a concise summary of what was actually done.
5.  **Key decisions & rationale** — choices made and why. This should explain the reasoning behind implementation choices, referencing project context, files, and user requests.
6.  **Current state** — what is working and what is still in progress.
7.  **Files touched** — repository-relative paths of modified files (excluding the snapshot file itself), with a one-line note each.
8.  **Key files read** — up to 50 of the most important files read during the session, with a one-line note each, using the agent's assessment to select those most relevant to the work.
9.  **Verification** — tests or checks performed, their results, and anything not yet verified.
10. **Working-tree state** — a concise status summary, including whether unrelated changes were already present, and listing all file names normally included in the output from `git status`.
11. **Open questions / blockers** — anything unresolved.
12. **Next steps** — concrete, actionable points to resume from.
13. **Key commands & references** — commands, URLs, or docs worth keeping.

### Safety and portability

- Write plain Markdown that does not depend on a particular agent, model, client, IDE, operating system, or proprietary session format.
- Do not include full conversation transcripts, secrets, credentials, authentication headers, private keys, or secret environment-variable values.
- Use repository-relative paths.
- Distinguish verified facts from assumptions and recommendations.
- Record commands and verification results, but omit large logs and full diffs unless indispensable.
- Review the finished snapshot for accidental sensitive information before saving or committing it.

### Committing (Git repositories only)

Before committing, run `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`. If it fails (not a Git repository), report the written file path and stop — do not attempt a commit.

The rules in this subsection replace the standard commit-message rules under Git Workflow for session snapshot commits.

If it succeeds, commit **only** the snapshot file, using a pathspec commit so that any other staged or unstaged changes remain untouched (see the Session Snapshot Exception above):

```
git add -- snapshots/<file>
git commit -m "Snapshot: <summary>" -m "<description>" --trailer "Co-authored-by: <agent> <email>" -- snapshots/<file>
```

- Replace `<summary>` with a short description (one sentence) of the work performed, and keep the first line to no more than 72 characters.
- Replace `<description>` with a 1–2 sentence description of the session's outcome.
- Replace `<agent>` and `<email>` with the name and email of the agent creating the snapshot. A trailer **must** be used for session snapshot commits.
- Options such as `-m` must come **before** the `--`; everything after `--` is treated as a file path, not an option.
- These commands are identical on Windows, macOS, and Linux; do not introduce a shell script or any Git Bash dependency.
- Verify that the resulting commit contains only the snapshot and that pre-existing staged and unstaged changes remain present and unchanged.
